A basic network sniffer is a tool or software that captures and analyzes network traffic. It allows you to monitor data packets being transmitted over a network, which can help in troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and security analysis.

How It Works:-
A network sniffer operates by:
Capturing Packets: It listens to network traffic passing through a device or a network interface.
Analyzing Data: It extracts useful information from captured packets, such as source/destination IP addresses, protocols used, and content (if not encrypted).
Displaying or Logging Information: The collected data is displayed in real-time or stored for further analysis.

Types of Network Sniffers:-
Software-Based Sniffers: Tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and Tshark.
Hardware-Based Sniffers: Dedicated devices that capture and analyze traffic.

Use Cases:-
Ethical hacking & penetration testing
Monitoring network traffic for troubleshooting
Detecting malicious activities
