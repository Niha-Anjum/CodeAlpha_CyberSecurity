Install scapy if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:

pip install scapy

You may need to run your script with administrative privileges (e.g., using sudo on Linux) to capture packets.

Example Code: 
from scapy.all import sniff

def packet_callback(packet):
    # Print a summary of the packet
    print(packet.summary())

def start_sniffer(interface=None):
    # Start sniffing packets
    print("Starting the sniffer...")
    sniff(iface=interface, prn=packet_callback, store=0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # You can specify the network interface to sniff on, e.g., 'eth0', 'wlan0', etc.
    # If you want to sniff on all interfaces, you can set interface=None
    start_sniffer(interface=None)

Save the code to a file, for example, sniffer.py.
Run the script with administrative privileges:

sudo python sniffer.py
